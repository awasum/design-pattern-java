#Desciption

Here our aim is to build/construct robots. And from a user point of view he/she needs to supply only the
color and material for his/her robot through the RobotFacade (See our FacadePatternExample.java file.) Our
RobotFacade (RobotFacade.java) will in turn create objects for RobotBody, RobotColor, RobotMetal and
will do the rest for the user. We need not worry about the creation of these separate classes and their calling
sequence. All of the classes have their corresponding implementation here.
